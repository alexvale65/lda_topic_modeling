# lda_topic_modeling
#
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is an unsupervised approach for identifying patterns and hidden or latent structures <br /> 
in unstructured objects such as text documents, labeling and interpreting the content based on the words contained in <br />
the material. The figure below provides a generic overview of the algorithm's application. Essentially, the application <br />
of the LDA model aims to identify latent topics by analyzing the most frequent words present in each topic and then <br />
grouping the documents based on the proportion of each topic they represent. (TAVANA, M.; SHAABANI, A.; JAVIER SANTOS-<br />
